## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Define a queue worker container that reuses the Laravel application image and processes queued jobs.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 `queue` service in Docker Compose uses the same Laravel image as the `app` service (`laravel-app:latest`).
- [ ] #2 Service runs a queue worker command (e.g., `php artisan queue:work`) and connects to the Redis queue backend.
- [ ] #3 Environment variables align with the `app` service so jobs execute with the same configuration.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
- Define the `queue` service in Compose to reuse the `laravel-app:latest` image with the same volume mounts and environment block as the `app` service.
- Override the container command to run `php artisan queue:work` against the Redis connection with sensible defaults (sleep, tries, timeout).
- Ensure service depends on `redis` (and optionally `db`) health, and disable Xdebug when running the worker for performance by setting `XDEBUG_MODE=off`.
