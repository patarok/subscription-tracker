## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Generate a fresh Laravel 12 project within the repository using Composer via the existing app container.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Composer create-project command runs against Laravel 12 and populates the repository directory.
- [x] #2 Existing Docker-related files (docker/, docker-compose.yml, README updates) are preserved.
- [x] #3 Temporary scaffolding directories created during the process are removed afterward.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
- Use `docker compose run --rm app` with Composer to scaffold Laravel 12 into a temporary directory inside the container.
- Copy generated Laravel files into the repository root while keeping existing Docker assets untouched.
- Remove any temporary directories or cache artifacts created during the generation step.
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Scaffolded Laravel 12 (v12.10.0) into `_scaffold/` via `docker compose run --rm app composer create-project laravel/laravel:^12 /var/www/_scaffold`, addressed git safe directory warning (no change needed), corrected ownership from inside container, and copied framework files into repo root while preserving Docker assets.
