## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Generate a fresh Laravel 12 project within the repository using Composer via the existing app container.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Composer create-project command runs against Laravel 12 and populates the repository directory.
- [ ] #2 Existing Docker-related files (docker/, docker-compose.yml, README updates) are preserved.
- [ ] #3 Temporary scaffolding directories created during the process are removed afterward.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
- Use `docker compose run --rm app` with Composer to scaffold Laravel 12 into a temporary directory inside the container.
- Copy generated Laravel files into the repository root while keeping existing Docker assets untouched.
- Remove any temporary directories or cache artifacts created during the generation step.
